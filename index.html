                Ever since I kicked in a ball for the first time, I became in love with sports. I started running at 6 years old, then I started playing football at 8 and finally I started swimming at 10. I continued practicing these sports until I came to college in Singapore were unfortunately the lack of school-facilities made it impossible to continue all three sports

                <h3>
               My favorite series is arguably the best series of 2023, “ The Last of US”. This masterpiece is inspired by the video game that has been released a couple years ago. The Last of Us contends for the title of best series ever due to its powerful blend of character development, emotional resonance, and a masterfully crafted post-apocalyptic world.  The bond between Joel, a hardened smuggler, and Ellie, a teenage girl immune to the deadly infection, forms the heart of the story.
